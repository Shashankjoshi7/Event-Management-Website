        <p class="text-muted" >Our Mission is to organise any type of event, for anyone in England, at affordable and reasonable prices. Jubilation Junction tries to be more eco friendly and sustainable at any event or function.
          The main goal of our company is to bring the communities together and ensure people are making friends and having a good time. You might be wondering why we are better than other event comapnies. And there is a reason
           for that, it is that we have 3 bases in the entire of england already in the first week of business and we are making changes overtime and new offers are soon to come out.

    <p>Unfortunatley, last weekend we said goodbye to our bleoved Mr Smith. Two weeks before that, we got a call from the Smith Family, saying whether we could organize the funeral. I was shocked and devastated, since it was a first timer
       for us, I told them we could do it for them. So one the day we went, we set up, all the food and the decorations, it was not even bad, so we decided funerals will be new to our event city.

      <p>2022, was ended in the best way possible, me and my team arrived at the venue, and it was the best hall ever, we got right into it and decorated the best we ever did in our life. The food was specatular, everyone liked it
         and came for the second round. The DJ and the music was the best as well, the vibe and the dancing was there. The program finished on time as well and there wasnt even a bad thing as well.

    <p>When our team was discussing how we oragize for birthdays, we said to make it one colour them and the customer chooses the colour. But we were struggling on what to do for entertainment, But John said that we should call in someone
       to entertain the audience, but Harvey said the best thing ever, he told the company that we should perform an unexpected skit, it could be comedy, drama or thriller. </p>
